-- Search --
Search the database. Returns a paginated list of search results (30 per page). Pagination information is included at the bottom of the response. You can specify further pages with the `?page` parameter. For example, to view the second page: `api/search?keyword=parks&page=2`.

All search results are cached for 5 minutes.

Accepted parameters and values:

`keyword`: Any search term

`location`: A valid full address (street address, city, state), or `city, state`, or 5-digit ZIP code

`radius`: A number between 0.1 and 10 (miles)

`sort` (*Optional*): `name`

`order` (*Optional*): one of `asc` or `desc`

If a search query contains neither `keyword` nor `location`, it will return an error.

Searches that include the `location` parameter will be sorted by distance by default. To sort them by name, add `&sort=name` to the query. When the `order` parameter is not present, the sort will be in ascending order by default. For descending order, add `&order=desc` to the query. 

Searches that don't include the `location` parameter will be sorted alphabetically in ascending order. For descending order, add `&order=desc` to the query.
