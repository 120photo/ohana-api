Major eligibility requirements for the postponement program are: (1) all owners (except spouse and direct-line relatives) must be either age 62 or over or be blind or disabled at time of application. (2) All owners (except spouse and direct-line relatives) must have lived in the home as of December 31 of the previous year.

The Centralized Intake Unit, which consists of a multi-disciplinary staff of social workers, public health nurses and deputy public guardians, conducts comprehensive assessments of the client and the allegations, provides information and referral, access and advocacy to county-operated and/or community-based programs as part of the service plan that is developed. Centralized Intake has a 24-Hour Response Program. A social worker receives telephone calls from the community, assesses the client-related matter over the telephone, makes a home visit if appropriate, and may provide short-term emergency protection such as shelter, food, or protective supervision until a long-term plan is developed by an assigned case manager. The Centralized Intake's Representative Payee Program serves individuals who are not conserved, but who need assistance in managing their public benefits.
